AutoScroll is a directive that auto scroll a container if the user is dragging a tactile block and the container scroll height is greater than it's height.
## AutoScroll used as a directive

```
<div cui-autoscroll></div>
```

## AutoScroll used in a focus shift.
Since it's currently not possible to programatically inject directives into elements nor component you will need to instantiate the directive manually. This is how that's done in a focus shift.

```
import { DraggableService, AutoScroll } from '@ericsson/oden';

export class LibraryFocusShiftComponent extends FocusShiftBaseComponent implements OnDestroy {
    autoScroll: AutoScrollDirective;

    constructor(element: ElementRef, renderer: Renderer2, dragggableService: DraggableService) {
        super(element, renderer);
        this.autoScroll = new AutoScrollDirective(element, renderer, dragggableService);
    }

    ngOnDestroy() {
        this.autoScroll.ngOnDestroy();
    }
}
```
