#Main menu
* import { MainMenuModule, MainMenuService } from '@ericsson/oden';

This component should only be used on top level. The main menu works mostly via the service, 
except for some more static data such as profile data (name, image etc) and meta app data. 
The routes are set via the service `MainMenuService`

```
<cui-main-menu
    [profile]="ProfileModel"
    [appName]="string"
    [appProprietor]="string"
    [appVersion]="string">
</cui-main-menu>
```
        
###profile:_ProfileModel_
This input should be of type `ProfileModel` with at least name, imgUrl and email set. 

####profile.module.ts
```
export class ProfileModel extends QuickAssign {
    name: string; // The name that will be displayed
    imgUrl: string; // Where the profile image is located
    email: string; // User email
}
```

###appName:_string_
The name of the top-application.
 
###[appProprietor]_:string___*__
The Proprietor name of the top level application

###appVersion:_string___*__
The version of the top level application

###expandableMenu:_boolean_
Optional property. If true, mainmenu supports expand/collapse of the application item in the side bar. Defaults to false.

###method toggleMenu(): _boolean_
Toggles the opened/closed state of the main menu. Returns true if the method opened the menu, false otherwise.
This method can be ran from MainMenuService

###method openMenu(): _void_
Always opens the menu

###method close(): _void_
Always closes the menu

##MainMenuService
The main menu service is the service from which you specify the routes that should be available throughout the entire application.
Including sub routes to each and every TPG. Import MainMenuModule.forRoot() to instantiate MainMenuService

Your app is required create to an array of `MainMenuRoute`. This should be fairly simple, since it follows the JSON structure defined in the CUS-Developer guide.
See the mocked service `RouteLoaderServiceMock` defined in the Demo application for more information about this step.

The MainMenuService has three methods and one `EventEmitter`. 

###toggleMenu(): _void_
This method toggles the main menu (through the MainMenuComponent.toggleMenu method). The main menu listens to an event that is emitted by this method.

###setRoutes(Array&lt;MainMenuRoute&gt;):_void_
This method sets the routes for the main menu and is the only method you are required to run. The parameter for the MainMenuRoutes array should include all routes, including subroutes.
The service will map these MainMenuRoutes to `ParentRoute` with `ChildRoute` as children.

###getRoutes():_Array&lt;ParentRoute&gt;_
Returns the defined array of ParentRoute, if any. 

###onChange(Array&lt;ParentRoute&gt;):_EventEmitter_
Is emitted after the setRoutes method is ran.

See the `app.component.ts` and `app.component.html` in the Demo app for implementation examples.
