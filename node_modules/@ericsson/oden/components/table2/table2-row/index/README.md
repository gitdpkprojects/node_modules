# Oden Table Row Child Count Component

Basic Usage:
```
<td odenIndexCell></td>
```

## Structure

    <oden-table-row-child-count
        [count]="number">
    </oden-table-row-child-count>


### Inputs:

* **index** - number. Provide a number to display, overrides the default behaviour to calculate the index via table component

### Outputs:

* **onMoveRequest** `EventEmitter(IMoveRowEvent)` - After a user changes to index of a row (via a dialog) this event will give a output containing information about the move. You can for example use `ArrayHelper.move` to change your array. Note: To properly make the table detect a change you need to provide a new array instance. Cloning the array with `yourArray = [...yourArray]` is fine. 

### Interfaces: 
* **IMoveRowEvent**: `newIndex: number, oldIndex: number`. 

### Description:
Used for tables where you want the user to able to move rows
