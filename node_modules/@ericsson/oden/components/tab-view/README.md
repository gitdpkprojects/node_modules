#Tab view
*  Import { TabView, TabViewService, UnSub } from '@ericsson/oden';

All ViewComponents that's presented as a tab view need to be extended with the ```TabView``` class. By doing this, sliding animation will be added to the view and it calculates if the view should fade in from left or right, on activation / deactivation.

1. Specify animations annotation in the ```@Component``` decorator with the const ```TAB_VIEW.ANIMATION``` or `TAB_VIEW.ANIMATION_FULL` (no opacity change)  from ```components/tab-view/tab-view.constants.ts```
2. Extend your ViewComponent class with ```TabView``` class located in ```components/tab-view/tab-view.ts```
3. Set ```@HostBinding``` for ```@routeAnimation```. This sets the animation direction of the view.
4. Set ```@HostBinding``` for class. This sets the necessary css styles for the view.
4. Call super class with the services TabViewService and ActivatedRoute. TabView class together with TabViewService handles how the animation should behave.
5. In your router config, provide tabIndex with correct index of your ViewComponent as a property of the data attribute. When the view is loaded, TabView class will register the provided tabIndex for the current ViewComponent. 


####Example of a tabbed ViewComponent:

```

	@Component({
	    ...
	    animations: [TAB_VIEW.ANIMATION]
	})
	
	export class MyTabViewComponent extends TabView {
	    @HostBinding('@routeAnimation') animationDirection: string;
	    @HostBinding('class') tabViewClass: string = 'tab-view';
	
	    constructor(tabViewService: TabViewService, router: ActivatedRoute) {
	        super(tabViewService, router);
	    }
	}
```

####Example of routing.ts:
```

    { path: 'tables', component: TablesListsComponent, data: { tabIndex: 0 } },
    { path: 'buttons', component: ButtonsComponent, data: { tabIndex: 1 } },
    { path: 'panels', component: PanelsComponent, data: { tabIndex: 2 } },
    { path: 'tiles', component: TilesComponent, data: { tabIndex: 3 } }
```

A working example of a tabbed view is available when running the demo app. Example code could be found in the following files: 

- ```src/demo-app/app/tpg/tpg.routes.ts```
- ```src/demo-app/app/tpg/buttons/buttons.component.ts```

###Two tab view animations
There are two different tab animations - `TAB_VIEW.ANIMATION` and `TAB_VIEW.ANIMATION_FULL`. The first one fades out/in
the tabs while moving from left to right and vice versa. The second one will show the full animation with no fading.

###@UnSub()
If you're using subscriptions in your page, you can push those into the built int `this._subscriptions` array and put the `@UnSub()` decorator above your component. This way your subscriptions will automically unsubscribe when you leave the page.

Example:

```
@UnSub()
export class MyComponent extends TabView {
...
    this._subscriptions.push(this.myService.subscribe((foo: any) => {
        ...
    }));
...
}
```
