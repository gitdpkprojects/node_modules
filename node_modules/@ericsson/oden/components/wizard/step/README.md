```
<cui-wizard-step [optional]="true" [title]="'Introduction'" [completed]="false" [locked]="false" [icon]="string" [iconTooltip]="string"
 (onEnter)="callback($event)" (onLeave)="callback($event)">
    <cui-wizard-summary>Summary for step 1</cui-wizard-summary>
    <cui-wizard-content>
        <p>Step content</p>
    </cui-wizard-content>
</cui-wizard-step>
```
