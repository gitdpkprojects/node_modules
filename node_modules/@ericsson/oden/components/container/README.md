#Rows & Columns
* import { ContainerModule, ROW_ALIGNMENT, COLUMN_ALIGNMENT } from '@ericsson/oden';

A layout is created by the use of three basic components. They are used in the order of container -> row -> column.
At the root level there must always be a container. 

```
<cui-container>
    <cui-row>
        <cui-column column-size="4">
            1
        </cui-column>
        <cui-column column-size="4">
            <cui-row>
                <cui-column column-size="6">2.1</cui-column>
                <cui-column column-size="6">2.2</cui-column>
            </cui-row>
        </cui-column>
        <cui-column column-size="4">
            3
        </cui-column>
    </cui-row>
</cui-container>
```

##&lt;cui-container&gt;
The container applies a gutter to the row(s) and should always be present when using rows and columns. Do not add a cui-container inside another cui-container.

##&lt;cui-row&gt;
Columns should always have a row as a parent. A row that can hold up to 12 columns that together should have a max column size of 12, ie 4+4+4, 6+6 or 8+4. Rows can be nested within columns for to build more complex layouts.

###align:_ROW_ALIGNMENT_|_Array<ROW_ALIGNMENT>_
It's possible to align the columns in a row to the right end, to the center, to the bottom, to the middle or with equal space between them. 
To do that, add `[align]="value"` to your `<cui-row>` tag, where `value` is your choice of `ROW_ALIGNMENT`. It's also possible to combine two alignments - just provide an array of alignments. 

###keepSizeForMedium:_boolean_
It's possible to override default column balance for medium screens.

##&lt;cui-column&gt;
The column is the final element in the layout structure and demands a _column-size_ value.

###column-size_:number___*__
The size of a column, should be between 1 and 12. The total number of columns in a row should never exceed 12. column-size can be used as an input with a dynamic Number value if it needs to be changed. 

###align:_COLUMN_ALIGNMENT_|_Array<COLUMN_ALIGNMENT>_
It's possible to align a single column in a row to the right end, to the center, to the bottom or to the middle. 
To do that, add `[align]="value"` to your `<cui-column>` tag, where `value` is your choice of `COLUMN_ALIGNMENT`. It's also possible to combine two alignments - just provide an array of alignments.
