#Rule visualisation
* import { IRuleAction, IRuleCondition, IRuleEvent, RuleContainerModule, LAYOUT, BlockTree } from '@ericsson/oden';

The rule visualisation contains a set of one or many conditions, a single event and a single action. It also supports
the `BlockTree` model.
```
<cui-rule-container
    [conditions]="Array<IRuleCondition>"
    [event]="IRuleEvent"
    [action]="IRuleAction"
    [blockTree]="BlockTree"
    [layout]="LAYOUT">
</cui-rule-container>
```

###[conditions]:_Array&lt;IRuleCondition&gt;___*__
Should be an array of the objects you want to display. Your objects should implement the `IRuleCondition` interface.

###[event]:_IRuleEvent_
Should be one single object you want to display. Your object should implement the `IRuleEvent` interface.

###[action]:_IRuleAction_
Should be one single object you want to display. Your object should implement the `IRuleAction` interface.

###[layout]:_LAYOUT_
Your choice of layout, either `LAYOUT.HORIZONTAL` (default) or `LAYOUT.VERTICAL`. Vertical layout can show `AND` conditions (`isAnyOperator=false`) and `OR` conditions (`isAnyOperator=true`) simultaneously, 
while the horizontal layout only has support for either of them.

###[blockTree]:_BlockTree_
Optional. By passing your `BlockTree` model to the Rule visualisation you will get a visual representation of your block tree. This will
set the layout to `LAYOUT.VERTICAL` automatically. You can combine the `[event]` input with `[blockTree]`, but the other inputs will be ignored.
