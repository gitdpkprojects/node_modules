#File upload
* import { FormModule } from '@ericsson/oden';

To add a file picker/uploader to your application, simply use this `cui-upload` component.

```
<cui-upload [(ngModel)]="FileList"
    [label]="string" 
    [multiple]="boolean"
    [accept]="Array<string>">
</cui-upload>
```

###(ngModel):_FileList___*__
When selecting file(s) the component will return a [FileList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FileList) object to your `ngModel`.

###label:_string___*__
This is the text that is shown as a placeholder when no files have been selected. It becomes a 
label above the field when a file has been chosen.

###multiple:_boolean_
Set this to true if you want to support multiple file selection.

###accept:_Array&lt;string&gt;_
Pass an array with accepted mime types or file extensions here if you want to limit the accepted files. This parameter
is just like the native `accept` parameter, except it takes an Array with strings instead of one string.
Example:
`[accept]="['image/*','.pdf']"`

###file\_id:_string_
A unique ID for the uploader element, will be used inside the component template (see below). Optional, if not used
the component will create a unique ID itself.
