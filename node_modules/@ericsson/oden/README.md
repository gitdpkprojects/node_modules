# Oden
Oden is a library containing a various UI component for Angular 4 projects. Each and every component have it's own documentation. Documentation in README.md contains implementation details, how to use a component as well as the expected data to pass in to it and in some case what data that comes out from it.

## Getting started

### Recommendation
- Node 7.x.x (tested on Node 7.9.0)

*Note: We recommend installation of NVM for easier downgrade / upgrade of node versions*
If you are using NVM, simply run

    nvm install 7.9.0
    nvm use 7.9.0

If you are not using nvm, uninstall any current version of Node and install node 7.9.0

### Install @angular/cli globally

    npm install @angular/cli@1.2.0 -g

### For Windows developers
Sometimes when installing all NPM packages Windows users get a lot of error while installing package node-gyp. node-gyp is a c lib that needs to be compiled on the local machine. Depending on your Visual Studio settings, sometimes the installation works, sometimes not. The easiest way to fix this is is install *Windows build tools* package ```npm install --global --production windows-build-tools```

Read more about this at node-gyp GitHub page. [https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)

### RM level (CUS)
Install the library from NPM register. Run: ```npm install @ericsson/oden --save --registry https://arm.epk.ericsson.se/artifactory/api/npm/proj-rm-ui-npm```

#### Implementation
**Important**: Please, do not import files explicity, use the barrel:

 - ```@ericsson/oden``` Contains all constants, models, modules, components, interfaces, services and classes.

To start using the library it has to be imported in the root module in the application.

1. Import OdenModule into the root module of your application

		import { OdenModule } from '@ericsson/oden'

		@NgModule({
		    imports: [
		        OdenModule.forRoot()
				...
		    ]
		})

2. Import the global styles in the main ```styles.scss``` file. In an Angular CLI app, add this into ```src/styles.scss```
	```@import "../node_modules/@ericsson/oden/assets/styles/global";```

### Application level (TPG)
The library is a part of the RM application level (CUS). Because of this, the library should be added as a dev dependency on application level. To do this run: ```npm install @ericsson/oden --save-dev --registry https://arm.epk.ericsson.se/artifactory/api/npm/proj-rm-ui-npm```

#### Implementation
To start using the library you can import OdenModule in the root module in the application. This will import all Oden components and instantiate its services. In larger applications with lazyloaded modules, it's recommend to just import the modules needed for each page and with the static forRoot() method decide if the module services should be instantiated or not. Read the documentation for each component for more info.

1. Import OdenModule into the root module of your application

		import { OdenModule } from '@ericsson/oden'

		@NgModule({
		    imports: [
		        OdenModule
				...
		    ]
		})

2. Import the global styles in the main ```styles.scss``` file. In an Angular CLI app, add this into ```src/styles.scss```
	```@import "../node_modules/@ericsson/oden/assets/styles/global";```

After this is done, all components are now available within application to be used.

## Components
Each and every component has it own README.md containing implementation details. If you clone the library repository you can also see a live example of all component in the demo app. Read [our contribution guide](#/readme/contribute) for more information to get started.

## Interfaces
The library provides interface files for the data driven components. This means that the models that gets passed to the component, need to implement the interface the component requires. The interface files are located in ```./src/common-ui/core/interfaces/```

## Supported Browsers
These are the browsers supported :
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Edge
- Evergreen browsers

Please make sure that the browser language is set to English.

## Upgrading (2017-08-22)
The project has been upgraded from Angular 2 to Angular 4. You can find specific information regarding how to do this locally in `UPGRADE.md` in project root.
