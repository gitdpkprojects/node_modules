## CUS boilerplate
CUS boilerplate is a library with systembar and main menu meant for the use of TPGs for their application development.
TPG can install boilerplate through npm repository and use which provides a replica of CUS environment.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Node 5.x.x (tested on Node 5.12.0)

### For Windows developers
Sometimes when installing all NPM packages Windows users get a lot of error while installing package node-gyp. node-gyp is a c lib that needs to be compiled on the local machine. Depending on your Visual Studio settings, sometimes the installation works, sometimes not. The easiest way to fix this is is install *Windows build tools* package ```npm install --global --production windows-build-tools```

Read more about this at node-gyp GitHub page. [https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)

Note: *CUS boilerplate works fine with angular-cli@1.0.0-beta.19-3*

### Quickstart TPG Development
TPG can quickstart development using demo app which can be found here
[https://gerrit.epk.ericsson.se/plugins/gitiles/cus/com.ericsson.bss.rm.cus/+/master/tools/tpg.demoapp/] (https://gerrit.epk.ericsson.se/plugins/gitiles/cus/com.ericsson.bss.rm.cus/+/master/tools/tpg.demoapp/)

### Steps to be followed with existing Angular2 Project

### Application Level(TPG)
This library should be added as a dev dependency on application level. To do this run: ```npm install @ericsson/cus --save-dev --registry https://arm.epk.ericsson.se/artifactory/api/npm/proj-rm-ui-npm```


#### Implementation
To start using the library,the below steps should be followed.

1. Update angular-cli.json index and styles as
   ```"index": "../node_modules/@ericsson/cus/boilerplate/index.html"```
   ```"styles": ["../node_modules/@ericsson/cus/boilerplate/styles.scss"]```

2. Import AppModule into main.ts as
   import { AppModule } from '../node_modules/@ericsson/cus/boilerplate/app/';

Note: To simplify TPGs work, a demo app is available for their reference.
It can be used directly to start development.*(It's upto TPG how to start developing their application)*

#### Mandatory step to be done
TPG should pass main module route  and reference through a configuration file added in the repository.
*Create a file app.configs.ts under src*

##### Sample content of app.configs.ts

```
import { DemoTpgModule } from './demotpg/demotpg.module';

export class AppConfig {
    static TPG_PATH: string = 'demotpg';
    static TPG_MODULE = DemoTpgModule;
}

```

In the above code, TPG_PATH refers to the main route and TPG_MODULE refers to the main module of TPG.
